## Chronica Node Logger


### Background: Chronica suite

Chronica is envisaged as suite of components and microservices to assist with centralized logging, analytics and monitoring.

The technology stack includes Node, Redis and ReactJS.

This is inspired by an earlier effort which used Java, SQL and AngularJS, namely <a href="https://github.com/evanx/chronic">Chronic</a>, which has been abandoned.
